# Salt-Identification

I competed in the TGS Salt Identification challenge by building a data pipeline and multiple neural networks to infer salt deposits from seismic imaging. I spend about two months working on this project. My submission scores about 0.68, which means that it can infer salt deposits far better than me, about average for machine learning algorithms in general. 

My pipeline normalizes the seismic images, augments them, and then maps them images of salt using deep learning. Here are some results.

Here's what the competition's about:

Several areas of Earth with large accumulations of oil and gas also have huge deposits of salt below the surface.

But unfortunately, knowing where large salt deposits are precisely is very difficult. Professional seismic imaging still requires expert human interpretation of salt bodies. This leads to very subjective, highly variable renderings. More alarmingly, it leads to potentially dangerous situations for oil and gas company drillers.
